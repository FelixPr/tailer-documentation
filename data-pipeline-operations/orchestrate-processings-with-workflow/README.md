# Orchestrate processings with Workflow

## ‚úÖ Compatible data operations

All data operations can be triggered with a Workflow data operation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

After you've deployed the data operation of your choice, you can deploy a Workflow data operation to determine how to trigger it.

Some data operations can also be launched through events or scheduling, so the Workflow data operation is optional.

## **üìã How to deploy a Workflow data operation**

A Workflow data operation is never deployed alone, as it is only used to trigger another data operation. To know how to deploy one, refer to the documentation associated to the data operation you want to trigger. To learn about the Workflow configuration file parameters, refer to [this page](workflow-configuration-file.md).
