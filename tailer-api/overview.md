# Overview

## 🔐 What is the Tailer API?

The tailer API is a set of features intended for operations teams allowing them to control the orchestration of Tailer data pipelines, and to monitor the jobs executions.

## 💼 Use cases

Here are a few use cases of the Tailer API:

* Integrating Tailer data pipelines into larger business orchestrations
* Implementing more complex orchestration rules, such as the ones from $U or Vtom
* Monitoring the service quality of data pipelines and generating alerts when they don't run as planned
* Rebooting workflow with the resetting feature, and enabling/disabling data pipelines
