# API features

## üöÄ Launching a job's execution

Tables to Tables or Tables to Storage data operations can be launched through the Tailer API.

You need to provide the full identity of the job as input \(the **execution\_date** parameter is optional\):

```bash
TAILER_API_API=`python3 google-jwt-generator.py your-credentials.json` \
&& curl --request POST \
--http2 \
--header "content-type:application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TAILER_API_API}" \
--data '{ "action": "launch_job",
          "account": "000110",
          "environment": "DEV",
          "configuration_type": "gbq-to-gbq",
          "configuration_id": "000110-tailer-TTT-POC-ETL-VTE_DEV",
          "job_id": "gbq-to-gbq|000110-tailer-TTT-POC-ETL-VTE_DEV",
          "execution_date": "2020-11-09"}' \
"https://tailer-api-nqonovswsq-ew.a.run.app/v1/dag/launch"
```

As a result, the job is launched and you get a unique run ID in the following format: 

```bash
"run_id": "20201105-1588f12a-73f0-4f5c-8592-5cd3ce793a29"
```

## üèÉ‚ôÇ Checking a run's status

Once you have a run ID, you can check its current status to see how the processing is going.

You need to provide the full identity of the job and the run ID as input:

```bash
TAILER_API_API=`python3 google-jwt-generator.py your-credentials.json` \
&& curl --request POST \
--http2 \
--header "content-type:application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TAILER_API_API}" \
--data '{"action": "check_run_status",
         "account": "000110",
         "environment": "DEV",
         "configuration_type": "gbq-to-gbq",
         "configuration_id": "000110-tailer-TTT-POC-ETL-VTE_DEV",
         "job_id": "gbq-to-gbq|000110-tailer-TTT-POC-ETL-VTE_DEV",
         "run_id": "20201105-1588f12a-73f0-4f5c-8592-5cd3ce793a29"}' \
"https://tailer-api-nqonovswsq-ew.a.run.app/v1/dag/status"
```

## ‚åõ Getting the last status of a job/data operation

You can check the current status for the latest run of a job/data operation.

You need to provide the full identity of the job/data operation as input.

If needed, you can specify some parameters for the job/data operation in order to target a specific one.

**Example with a job**

```bash
TAILER_API_API=`python3 google-jwt-generator.py your-credentials.json` \
&& curl --request POST \
--http2 \
--header "content-type:application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TAILER_API_API}" \
--data '{ "action": "get_last_status", 
          "account": "000110", 
          "environment": "DEV", 
          "configuration_type": "storage-to-storage",
          "configuration_id": "000110-tailer-STS-POC-ETL-VTE",
          "job_id": "storage-to-storage|000110-tailer-STS-POC-ETL-VTE"}' \
"https://tailer-api-nqonovswsq-ew.a.run.app/v1/dag/status"
```

**Example with a data operation**

```bash
TAILER_API_API=`python3 google-jwt-generator.py your-credentials.json` \
&& curl --request POST \
--http2 \
--header "content-type:application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TAILER_API_API}" \
--data '{ "action": "get_last_status", 
          "account": "000110", 
          "environment": "DEV", 
          "configuration_type": "storage-to-storage",
          "configuration_id": "000110-tailer-STS-POC-ETL-VTE"}' \
"https://tailer-api-nqonovswsq-ew.a.run.app/v1/dag/status"
```

**Example with a data operation with specific parameters**

```bash
TAILER_API_API=`python3 google-jwt-generator.py your-credentials.json` \
&& curl --request POST \
--http2 \
--header "content-type:application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TAILER_API_API}" \
--data '{ "action": "get_last_status", 
          "account": "000110", 
          "environment": "DEV", 
          "configuration_type": "storage-to-storage",
          "configuration_id": "000110-tailer-STS-POC-ETL-VTE"
          "execution_date": "2020/11/19",
          "limit": 10}' \
"https://tailer-api-nqonovswsq-ew.a.run.app/v1/dag/status"
```

## Resetting a workflow

The Tailer API allows you to reset a workflow. The reset feature deletes all the triggered jobs so the workflow can start from scratch, as when the data operation was just deployed. \(This feature is also available in Tailer Studio.\)

**Example of a case requiring a workflow reset**

We have three jobs, named JA, JB, and JC which trigger a job named JT when they are all successfully executed.

If a situation happens where JA and JB are OK, but JC is not, JT is not triggered. You fix and relaunch JC, which becomes OK, and JT is triggered. The next morning, you launch JC again to make sure it works: you get JA\(0\), JB\(0\) and JC\(1\). When JA and JB are automatically started a few hours later, JC is already considered as OK, which creates an unbalanced situation. A reset is necessary.

```bash
TAILER_API_API=`python3 google-jwt-generator.py your-credentials.json` \
&& curl --request POST \
--http2 \
--header "content-type:application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TAILER_API_API}" \
--data '{ "action": "reset_workflow_status", 
          "account": "000110", 
          "environment": "DEV", 
          "configuration_type": "workflow",
          "configuration_id": "000110-tailer-workflow-count"}' \
"https://tailer-api-nqonovswsq-ew.a.run.app/v1/workflow/status"
```
